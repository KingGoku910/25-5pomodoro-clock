# 25-5pomodoro-clock
I built a 25 + 5 pomodoro clock with HTML, CSS, jQuery and JavaScript, the idea of a pomodoro clock is to have an individual work for an X amount of time and then take a break for an X amount of time. To promote productivity as well as giving the brain an opportunity to rest and recuperate.
